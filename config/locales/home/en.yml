      title: Trade Tools Navigator
      intro: TRADE Hub has compiled data regarding existing initiatives, measures, models, data providers, platforms, portals, and round table certifications, relevant to agriculture and commodity supply chains (the compendium is non-exhaustive, and is being continually updated).The Initiatives Data is the result of a collaborative effort involving Institutions and partners of the TRADE Hub. The materials on measurement approaches were in part derived from work undertaken by Johan Lammerant, Arcadis conducted on behalf of the European Business & Biodiversity Platform and the Aligning Biodiversity Measures for Business initiative led by UNEP-WCMC. We are particularly grateful to members from Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL), Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), University of Southampton and UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre who supported in the data collection.
