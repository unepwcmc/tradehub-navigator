      <p>
        The Trade Tools Navigator seeks to bring together existing initiatives
        in one place to help users understand the impacts of production and
        consumption on nature. The aim of the navigator is to add value to
        existing work and synthesize the tools currently available which are
        relevant to trade, impacts of trade, and commodity supply chains
      </p>

      <h2>Data and Methodology</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The data found in the Trade Tools Navigator is from existing databases
        from UNEP-WCMC from previous data inventories complied on supply chains,
        and trade. Online reviews and searches were and continue to be carried
        out for each commodity covered in the GCRF Trade Development and the
        Environment Hub using Google and key document searches, with
        standardised search terms, and targeted website searches.
