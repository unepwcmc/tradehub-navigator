      relevant to trade, impacts of trade, and commodity supply chains

    <p>
      The data found in the Trade Tools Navigator is from existing databases
      from UNEP-WCMC from previous data inventories complied on supply chains,
      and trade. Online reviews and searches were and continue to be carried out
      for each commodity covered in the GCRF Trade Development and the
      Environment Hub using Google and key document searches, with standardised
      search terms, and targeted website searches.
