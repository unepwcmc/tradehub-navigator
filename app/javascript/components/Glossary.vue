            A standardised good, which is traded in bulk and whose units are
            interchangeable. This includes agriculture products. Whether the

            TRADE Hub. Commodities are typically homogenous, with little
            variation across producers. This means they are largely regarded as
            substitutable and of equal economic value irrespective of the
            source.

            Repositories hold data and make it available to use but tend to be
            subject-specific and may be curated. Often used synonymously with a
            data archive (somewhere for the long-term storage of data) and data
            library (which suggests a level of active collection and curation
            for a specific subject or purpose). Other similar terms that offer
            insight into potential definitions are include data lake (large data
            repository that stores unstructured data that is classified and
            tagged with metadata), data warehouse (large data repository that
            aggregates data usually from multiple sources or segments of a
            business, without the data being necessarily related) and data mart
            (subsets of the data repository. These data marts are more targeted
            to what the data user needs and easier to use.
